  docs: `Spend on main-loop turns forming an unbroken run of at least
${SEARCH_LOOP_MIN_RUN} read-only exploration turns: reading, searching,
globbing, fetching, over and over with no coding, testing, planning or
shipping turn anywhere in between. Past that length the run has stopped being
research and become the agent re-orienting because it lost the thread (or was
never given one). The rule deliberately has no savings family: its spend does
not overlap the input-side cache levers, so it stays evidence and advice rather
than competing for a headline dollar total.

Main loop only. A subagent's job IS long unbroken reading; an explore agent
that pauses to edit is the broken one, so fan-outs are excluded rather than
flagged. Runs shorter than the floor stay quiet too: a focused dig of a few
read-only turns is exactly what an agent should be doing.

Savings price only what sits PAST the floor inside each qualifying run: the
first ${SEARCH_LOOP_MIN_RUN} turns of every run are treated as legitimate
research, which keeps the number conservative and easy to defend.`,

  docs: `Long sessions whose late-half context per turn is at least twice their
early half, with cache reads failing to keep pace — so the growth is re-paid as
fresh input rather than read cheaply. The remedy is a task boundary: compact, or
start a new session.

Measured over main-loop sessions only. A subagent run is spawned fresh, does one
job and exits, and nobody can compact it; counting runs would bury a real hygiene
problem in a denominator of things nobody can act on.

Fires when at least 30% of long sessions bloat and there are at least 3 of them.
Savings price the late-half excess fresh tokens at the fresh-minus-cache-read
delta — conservatively, since avoided context would have been cache reads at
best.`,

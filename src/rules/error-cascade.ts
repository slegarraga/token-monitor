  title: 'Error cascades: retrying against a broken premise',
  docs: `Spend inside runs of ${CASCADE_MIN_RUN}+ consecutive failed turns in one
session. A single failed turn is normal work; a run of them means the agent is
retrying against a broken premise (a wrong path, a missing permission, an
unavailable service) and every iteration re-pays full context to learn the same
thing again. Declinations are excluded upstream: a user saying no is not a
failure.

The accounting is deliberately conservative. The first two turns of every run
are treated as legitimate diagnosis and priced at zero; only the spend beyond
them counts as waste, and savings use that excess at the blended spend rate.
The gate and the message agree by construction: Metrics counts the runs (via
errorCascades), so a firing finding always has real runs behind it. The gate
still asks for more than one run and at least 5% of window spend, because a
single stumble can be diagnosis while repeated cascades are the pattern.

The fix is not "retry harder": it is to stop after the second failure and
change exactly one thing: name the wrong premise, then re-run.`,

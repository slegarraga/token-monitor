  docs: `Turns that resume after a gap longer than their session's prompt-cache TTL
re-pay the whole context as fresh input instead of reading it cheaply. The gap is
measured against the TTL the session actually used: Claude Code reports how each
cache write split between the 5-minute and 1-hour tiers, and a session whose
writes are mostly 1-hour is scored against an hour.

Main-loop only on both sides of the ratio. A subagent run is a back-to-back burst
that never idles, and its remedy — batch prompts, split idle work — cannot be
applied to something that is spawned and exits.

Fires above 20% of main-loop fresh input, gated on main-loop spend so a small
conversation cannot clear the bar on the back of its fan-out. Beyond the target
savings, the rule adds a second, separately-priced remedy: for sessions still on
the 5-minute cache, what turning on the 1-hour cache would net after its higher
write premium.`,

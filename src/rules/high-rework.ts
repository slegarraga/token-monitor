turn in a session. High rework is the signature of work that started before it
was specified: the agent codes, the test fails, and every subsequent turn pays a
full context to iterate.

Distinct from analyze's fix iterations, which counts testing->coding transitions
— a session that barely tests can have high rework and no visible loops.
User-declined permission prompts are not failures and never count.

Fires above 20%. Savings price the excess over the target at the blended spend

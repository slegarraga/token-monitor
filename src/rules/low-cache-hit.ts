  docs: `Cache reads are billed at roughly a tenth of fresh input, so the share of
input-side tokens served from cache is the single largest cost lever in the data.
A low ratio usually means sessions are short-lived, the system context keeps
changing between turns, or work is spread across many cold starts.

Fires below 50% on windows with more than 100k spend tokens. The savings figure
prices the tokens that would move from the fresh-input rate to the cache-read
rate if the ratio reached its target — the user's own top-quartile sessions when
there are enough of them, 80% otherwise.`,

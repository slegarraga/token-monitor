  docs: `Spend in work STREAMS — a project plus a branch — that contain coding turns
and reached no commit, push, PR or merge anywhere in the window, and have then sat
idle for at least ${ABANDON_IDLE_DAYS} days.

Three guards keep this from becoming an accusation:

- **Streams, not sessions.** Coding on Monday and shipping on Wednesday from a new
  session is one stream that shipped. Sources with no branch information fall back
  to per-session grouping, which is coarser and says so.
- **Never work in flight.** A stream touched inside the idle window is reported as
  *open* and excluded from the finding entirely. Accusing someone's current branch
  of being abandoned is the fastest way to make an outcome metric worthless.
- **Main loop only, and coding only.** A subagent run ships through its caller, and
  a stream that never wrote code was never trying to ship.

Research, spikes and learning ship nothing by design and are not waste. The metric
answers exactly one question: how much of this window's spend went to code that
reached no ship signal. \`analyze\` lists the streams — locally; branch names name
features and clients and never leave the machine.

Fires above 25% of spend with at least two idle streams. Savings are priced at the
blended spend rate over the idle streams only, and are a **ceiling**: they assume
the work would not have been done at all, which is rarely the whole truth.`,
